# Schedule
A custom schedule maker.

This application takes a list of employees and a list of days in a month. It then distributes the employees throughout the month by assigning them shifts during the day or during the night.  


Each employee can work either day or nightshift and each employee can be a leader. Each time an employee is assigned a shift in a day their weekly and monthly hours are raised for the duration of the shift (10.5, 10 or 12 hours).


There is a limit to how many hours per week (56) and per month (176) an employee can work. 
There are also limits to how many days in a row an employee can be assigned to shifts (3 for 10-12 hour shifts and 4 for 8 hour shifts).
All the employees are listed on the sidebar with the roles that they can perform (nightshift, leader).


At the bottom of the page you can find the remaining hours that selected employees can still work in the selected week before they reach their week limit. The employees are displayed by hovering over a day at the top of the timetable. The selected employees background in the table is changed to red for a short period of time.
